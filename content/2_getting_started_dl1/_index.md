Showcase the AWS DL1 instance featuring the Habana Gaudi HPU. This 4 hour session will
introduce users to the new instance and show the step-by-step to starting an instance, running Habana’s
default models and taking a public model to the instance. Will include hands-on lab with Habana and
AWS engineers showing how to execute, 

We assume this audience will have varied level of experienced across HW and
ML experience. The Goal is to drive customers to actively implement and optimize models on EC2 DL1
Instance. This group is willing to spend the 4 hours to learn how to run models on the Gaudi DL1
instance. This group may not have experience using EC2 on CPUs or GPUs in the past.
Note that a subset of this content will be used to create the 1 hour “certification” online class that will
be a subset. We assume 3 hours or content.
